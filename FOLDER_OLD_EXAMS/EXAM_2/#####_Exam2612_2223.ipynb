In a simple economic model, TSLA stock should be high if Lithium prices are low, as margins increase. Technology firms are incredibly susceptible to commodity price increases. However, if commodity prices increase, ALBE will tend to be traded at a higher value. This could decerase TSLA value, as margins decrease (again, this is a very simplistic interpretation just for the sake of this simple analysis).\n",
