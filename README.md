Advanced Programming for Data Science: 2025

## Setting up

Not all students are using the same Operating System (OS). The goal of this course is to show you development methods that are independent of OS. Some tools and ways to do things will vary slightly.

Please make sure you have:

1. [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) or [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your own choice of IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The classes and videos will be shown in Jupyter Lab.
1. [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
1. A [github](https://github.com/) account (don't worry it is free). We suggest you fill up your profile as it can act as an extension of your Linkedin account. Recruiters notice it.
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your machine. For Windows, please install [git-bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
